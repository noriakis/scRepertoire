\title{Examining the clonal overlap between groups or samples}
\usage{
clonalOverlap(
  df,
  cloneCall = "strict",
  method = NULL,
  chain = "both",
  split.by = NULL,
  exportTable = FALSE,
  palette = "inferno",
  pcoa = FALSE,
  pcoa.group.by = NULL,
  point.size = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The product of \code{\link{combineTCR}}, \code{\link{combineBCR}}, or
\code{\link{combineExpression}}.}

\item{cloneCall}{How to call the clonotype - VDJC gene (gene), 
CDR3 nucleotide (nt), CDR3 amino acid (aa), or 
VDJC gene + CDR3 nucleotide (strict).}

\item{method}{The method to calculate the "overlap", 
for the base numbers.}

\item{chain}{indicate if both or a specific chain should be used - 
e.g. "both", "TRA", "TRG", "IGH", "IGL"}

\item{split.by}{If using a single-cell object, the column header 
to group the new list. NULL will return clusters.}

\item{exportTable}{Returns the data frame used for forming the graph}

\item{palette}{Colors to use in visualization - input any hcl.pals()}

\item{pcoa}{Plot PCoA plot instead of heatmap}

\item{pcoa.group.by}{grouping variable in PCoA plot, default to NULL}

\item{point.size}{point size in PCoA plot}
}
\value{
ggplot of the clonotypic overlap between elements of a list
}
\description{
This functions allows for the calculation and visualizations of 
various overlap metrics for clonotypes.

#Making combined contig data

                                    "P19B","P19L", "P20B", "P20L"))

              cloneCall = "gene", 
              method = "jaccard")
